# Edge-Detection-
Video Edge detection

#The basic steps involved in this algorithm are:

Noise reduction using Gaussian filter
Gradient calculation along the horizontal and vertical axis
Non-Maximum suppression of false edges
Double thresholding for segregating strong and weak edges
Edge tracking by hysteresis
